# Assets

This directory contains screenshots and other assets for the project documentation.

## Screenshots

To add the chat application screenshot:
1. Save the screenshot as `chat-screenshot.jpg` in this directory
2. The screenshot should show the working chat interface with a conversation example
3. Update the main README.md if the filename changes

The current README references `assets/chat-screenshot.jpg` which shows the SolidJS + PydanticAI chat application in action.
